Greedy Algos: seek to make a locally optimal choice at each stage
    Greedy algos have:
        - a set of things to choose from
        - a notion of "the best" among the set
        - a notion of feasibility within the set
        - an end state
    Solutions from greedy algos are almost always not the best solutions
        - are short sighted and non recoverable
